## **Project Workflow**

### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Wrangling
- Converted salary columns to numeric values  
- Handled missing values  
- Ensured data consistency for modeling  

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Summary statistics of salary distributions  
- Visual inspection of pay ranges  
- Identification of trends and outliers  

### 3️⃣ Outlier Detection & Handling
- Identified extreme salaries (e.g., executive-level pay)  
- Applied appropriate handling to prevent model bias  

### 4️⃣ Feature Engineering
- Created relevant features from job titles, departments, and pay components  
- Encoded categorical variables for modeling  

### 5️⃣ Model Building
- Built regression models to predict **Base Pay**  
- Tested multiple algorithms and selected **Gradient Boosting** for best performance  

### 6️⃣ Model Evaluation & Visualization
- Evaluated using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R²  
- Visualized feature importance and predictions  

### 7️⃣ Insights & Interpretability
- Highlighted the main factors driving salaries  
- Provided actionable insights for payroll analysis
